# Vector Field Visualization üåê

This repository contains a Python script for generating and visualizing vector fields using `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. Create both quiver and stream plots of vector fields with customizable options.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Flexible Vector Field Generation**: Define your vector field function to visualize.
- **Stream Plot Option**: Include streamlines for better visualization of flow.
- **Normalization**: Option to normalize the vector field for unitary vectors.

## Dependencies üì¶

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Install them using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn
